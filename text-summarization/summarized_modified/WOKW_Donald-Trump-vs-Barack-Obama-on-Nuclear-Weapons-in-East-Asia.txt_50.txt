Donald Trump vs Barack Obama on Nuclear Weapons in East Asia

Donald Trump broke a lot of foreign-policy crockery last week. President Barack Obama dressed him down for encouraging South Korea and Japan to acquire nuclear weapons. NATO’s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, has criticized him too. Academics trying to parse Mr. Trump’s statements can’t figure out which “school” of foreign-policy thinking he belongs to.

The candidate’s set-to with the president, however, was far from frivolous. Mr. Trump suggested that, if South Korea and Japan had nuclear weapons, we could spend less protecting those allies. This approach, Mr. Obama rejoined, would reverse decades of U.S. policy on nuclear proliferation.

For all new nuclear powers (and those countries that decided not to go nuclear, such as Germany, Ukraine, and South Africa), the decisive factor was how they saw the main threats to their own security. Mr. Trump is right about one thing: The big question raised by North Korea’s success in building a nuclear arsenal is whether South Korea and Japan feel obliged to follow suit.
