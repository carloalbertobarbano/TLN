WOKW -> Counting occurencies of KW in titles might lead to select paragraphs apparently more relevant but with less cohesion -> more relevant information but more "standalone" paragraphs (lack of background)

WOWO -> Almost no words in titles are in nasari, so paragraphs are chosen by cohesion, which can lead to better results from a narrative perspective but details might be missing
